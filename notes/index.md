### Interpretation ###

* **Slower growth:** Functions like O(1), O(log n), and O(‚àön) grow slowly and are more efficient for large inputs.
* **Moderate growth:** O(n), O(n log n), and O(n¬≤) are typical in many algorithms.
* **Fast growth:** O(2‚Åø), O(e‚Åø), and specially O(n!) grow extremely fast and are impractical for large inputs.

### Operation Counting or Cost Model Analysis

**Operation counting** or **cost model analysis** in the context of algorithmic time complexity involves:

- Counting the number of **primitive operations** such as:
    - Assignments
    - Comparisons
    - Arithmetic operations
    - Read a variable value
    - Output
    - String formatting
- Expressing the **total cost as a function of input size** (e.g., `n`)
- Often used to derive the **exact number of operations** before simplifying to **Big-O notation**

### üß† Granularity in Operation Counting

The number of operations in a line of code can vary depending on the **level of analysis**, also known as **granularity**. Here's how it breaks down:

#### üîπ High-Level (Macro)
- Each line of code is treated as a single or grouped operation.
- This approach is useful for estimating algorithmic complexity, such as Big-O notation.

#### üîπ Mid-Level
- Lines are broken down into basic programming actions:
    - Memory access
    - Comparisons
    - Assignments

#### üîπ Low-Level (Micro / Assembly-Like)
- Analysis considers individual CPU instructions:
    - Register loading
    - Arithmetic operations
    - Branching
- This level is used for performance profiling and low-level optimization.

#### ‚úÖ Key Insight

The **operation count depends on the granularity** of your analysis.
- For **theoretical or algorithmic analysis**, a simplified count is sufficient.
- For **performance optimization**, a detailed breakdown is necessary.

### üìê Steps to Convert `20n + 50` into Big O Notation

#### 1. Identify the Variable
- Determine the input size variable, which is `n` in this case.

#### 2. Focus on Growth
- Big O describes how the number of operations grows as `n` increases.
- Constant values (like `50`) become negligible for large `n`.

#### 3. Drop Constant Coefficients
- The coefficient `20` in `20n` is ignored in Big O.
- Big O focuses on the rate of growth, not the exact number of operations.

#### 4. Keep the Dominant Term
- In `20n + 50`, the term `20n` dominates as `n` grows.
- The constant `50` is dropped.

#### ‚úÖ Final Big O Result
**O(n)**

This means the algorithm has **linear time complexity**, as the number of operations increases proportionally with the input size `n`.
