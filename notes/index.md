3. **Log-square**: O(log² n)
4. **Root-n**: O(√n)
5. **Linear**: O(n)

7. **Quadratic**: O(n²)
8. **Cubic**: O(n³)
9. **Quartic**: O(n⁴)
10. **Exponential**: O(2ⁿ)
11. **Exponential**: O(eⁿ)
12. **Factorial**: O(n!)

### Interpretation ###

* **Slower growth:** Functions like O(1), O(log n), and O(√n) grow slowly and are more efficient for large inputs.
* **Moderate growth:** O(n), O(n log n), and O(n²) are typical in many algorithms.
* **Fast growth:** O(2ⁿ), O(eⁿ), and specially O(n!) grow extremely fast and are impractical for large inputs.
